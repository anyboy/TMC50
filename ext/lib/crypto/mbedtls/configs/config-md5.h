/*
 * Minimal configuration for TLS 1.2 with PSK and AES-CCM ciphersuites
 * Distinguishing features:
 * - no bignum, no PK, no X509
 * - fully modern and secure (provided the pre-shared keys have high entropy)
 * - very low record overhead with CCM-8
 * - optimized for low RAM usage
 *
 * See README.txt for usage instructions.
